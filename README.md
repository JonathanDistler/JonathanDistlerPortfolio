## How to Add Images

1. **Profile Picture**:
   - Add your professional headshot as `profile.jpg` in this directory
   - The image will automatically display in the hero section
   - If no image is found, a placeholder will be shown

2. **Project Images**:
   - Add screenshots or photos of your projects
   - Name them `project1.jpg`, `project2.jpg`, `project3.jpg`
   - These will display in the project cards and modal popups
   - If no image is found, a gradient placeholder will be shown

## Image Optimization Tips

- Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim to compress images
- Keep file sizes under 500KB for faster loading
- Use WebP format for better compression (with JPG fallback)
- Ensure images are high quality but optimized for web

## Fallback Behavior

The website is designed to gracefully handle missing images:
- Profile image: Shows a placeholder with "Your Photo" text
- Project images: Shows a gradient placeholder with project number

This ensures your website looks professional even without images initially.
